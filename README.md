# DTM's THcrap Repository

Hello and welcome to my patch repository for the games in the Touhou series.  These patches use the [thcrap patching engine](https://thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center) which allows automatic updating and the ability to not have to modify game files.  Currently, the repository includes:
* **[alphes:](https://github.com/DTM9025/DTM/tree/master/alphes)** Replaces ZUN's character portrait art in favor of Dairi's (which is in alphes style)

To use any of these patches, simply download [thcrap](https://thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center:Download), run the configurer, and select the desired patch.  Note that generally, these patches should be selected after a language patch if you also want to use said language patch (e.g. lang_en -> alphes).  More detailed instructions are in the respective patch folder's README.
